\section{Storage}

Storage adapter types:

\begin{itemize}
\item SCSI
\item iSCSI
\item RAID
\item Fiber Channel
\item Fiber Channel over Ethernet (FCoE)
\item Ethernet
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}

  \item[HBA] host bus adapter, storage interface card

  \item [LUN] logical unit number, a device addressed by SCSI, iSCSI or Fiber
    Channel, logical disk

  \item[WWN] world-wide name, uniquely identifies a Fiber Channel adapter

  \item[target] a single storage unit that the host can access

\end{description}

Some storage vendors present a single target with multiple LUNs, some present
multiple targets with one LUN each.\\

If a LUN is shared by multiple hosts, it must be presented to all hosts with
the same UUID.\\

Runtime name is not a reliable identifier for a device and is not persistent.

\subsection{iSCSI}

\begin{description}
  \item[dependent hardware iSCSI] depends on VMware networking and interfaces
provided by VMware
\end{description}

\subsection{NFS}

The NFS client built into ESXi uses NFS version 3.

\subsection{Disk Shares}

Disk shares are relevant only within a given host.
