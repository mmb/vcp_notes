\subsection{Create and Configure VMware Clusters}

EVC (enhanced vMotion compatibility) allows hosts in a cluster with different
CPU families to use the common denominator of CPU features. When enabled on a
cluster, only compatible hosts may be added to the cluster. Even with EVC,
you cannot mix AMD and Intel in the same cluster.

\subsubsection{Create/Delete a DRS/HA Cluster}

\subsubsection{Add/Remove ESXi Hosts from a DRS/HA Cluster}

When adding an ESXi host to e DRS/HA cluster you specify the hostname or
IP address, username and password.

\subsubsection{Add/Remove virtual machines from a DRS/HA Cluster}

\subsubsection{Configure Storage DRS}

Storage DRS load balances VMs based on datastores. It can be used to profile
storage and attach SLAs to VMs.\\

Storage DRS is enabled with Storage vMotion.\\

Storage DRS can determine initial VM placement and perform automated load
balancing base on:

\begin{itemize}

\item space utilization
\item lowest latency

\end{itemize}

Storage DRS affinity rules can be based on:

\begin{itemize}

\item VMDK affinity
\item VMDK anti-affinity
\item VM anti-affinity (don't move my config files, but move my VMDKs)

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Configure Enhanced vMotion Compatibility}

\subsubsection{Monitor a DRS/HA Cluster}

\subsubsection{Configure migration thresholda for DRS and virtual machines}

\subsubsection{Configure automation levels for DRS and virtual machines}

\subsubsection{Create VM-Host and VM-VM affinity rules}

\subsubsection{Enable/Disable Host Monitoring}

\subsubsection{Enable/Configure/Disable virtual machine and application monitoring}

\subsubsection{Configure admission control for HA and virtual machines}

\subsubsection{Determine appropriate failover methodology and required resources for an HA implementation}
