\subsection{Create and Configure VMFS and NFS Datastores}

\subsubsection{Identify VMFS and NFS Datastore properties}

VMFS is the VMware filesystem, a specialized virtualization clustered
filesystem that provides distributed locking. VMFS can be local, iSCSI or
Fibre Channel. If NFS is being used, VMFS is not being used.\\

VMFS is optimized for VMs and high performance. It does not have a lot of
features compared to NTFS or other filesystems.\\

VMFS-5 is the latest version of VMFS. The maximum disk size for a VM is
64TB. The best practice is to format LUNs with and 8M block size?

Centralized storage is required for many advanced features of vSphere like
vMotion, HA, FT and DRS. Usually the central storage is a SAN.\\

Storage congestion threshold is set per datastore and is associated with
storage IO control.

\subsubsection{Identify VMFS5 capabilities}

\begin{itemize}

\item no more 2TB limit on VMFS volumes, the new limit is 64TB
\item supports 2TB RDMs
\item block size always 1 MB (no choice)
\item atomic test and set (part of VAAI), locking mechanism
\item sub-blocks for space efficiency (8K)
\item small file support (1K)
\item space reclamation on thin provisioned LUNs (with enhanced VAAI)
\item monitoring of space when using thin provisioning (with enhanced VAAI)

\end{itemize}

\item[VASA] vSphere APIs for Storage Awareness

\item[VAAI] vSphere APIs for Array Integration, support NFS now

\subsubsection{Create/Rename/Delete/Unmount a VMFS Datastore}

\subsubsection{Mount/Unmount an NFS datastore}

\subsubsection{Extend/Expand VMFS datastores}

\subsubsection{Upgrade a VMFS3 Datastore to VMFS5}

\subsubsection{Place a VMFS Datastore in Maintenance Mode}

\subsubsection{Select the Preferred Path for a VMFS Datastore}

ESXi fully supports SAN multipathing. Multpathing means there are multiple
paths through HBAs and FC switches to the same LUNs for redundancy.

\subsubsection{Disable a path to a VMFS Datastore}

\subsubsection{Determine use case for multiple VMFS/NFS Datastores}

\subsubsection{Determine appropriate Path Selection Policy for a given NFS Datastore}
