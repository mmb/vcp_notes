\subsection{Networking Best Practices}

\begin{itemize}

\item separate network services for security and performance

\item put vMotion on its own network using VLANs or a separate physical network
(preferred)

\item when using passthrough devices on Linux 2.6.20 or earlier avoid MSI
and MSI-X due to performance problems

\item create a standard or distributed switch for each network service, or
at least put them in port groups in different VLANs

\item as long as there is one uplink available, virtual machines and network
services will be able to connect to the physical network

\item deploy firewalls on virtual machines that route between networks with
uplinks to physical networks and networks with no uplinks

\item use vmxnet3 virtual NICs

\item every physical NIC connected to the same vSphere standard or distributed
switch should be on the same physical network

\item set all VMkernel network adapters to the same MTU

\end{itemize}
