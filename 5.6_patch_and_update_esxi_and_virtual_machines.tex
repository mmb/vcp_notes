\subsection{Patch and Update ESXi and Virtual Machines}

\subsubsection{Identify patching requirements for ESXi hosts and virtual machine hardware/tools}

\subsubsection{Create/Edit/Remove a Host Profile from an ESXi host}

\subsubsection{Attach/Apply a Host Profile to an ESXi host or cluster}

\subsubsection{Perform compliance scanning and remediation of an ESXi host using Host Profiles}

\subsubsection{Install and Configure vCenter Update Manager}

Update Manager enables centralized, automated patch and version management
for ESXi hosts, virtual machine hardware, VMware tools and virtual
appliances. Update Manager no longer patches guest OSs or guest applications.

Update Manager must be installed on a 64-bit machine.\\

Update Manager can scan for compliance and apply updates.\\

Update Manager reduces the number of reboots required after VMware Tools
updates.\\

Update Manager components:

\begin{description}

\item[Update Manager Server]
can be installed on vCenter Server or elsewhere

\item[Patch database]
exsting SQL Server database or SQL Server 2005 Express

\item[Update Manager plug-in]
for vSphere client

\item[Guest agents]
installed on VMs

\item[Download server]
optional, for downloading patches outside of the internal network

\end{description}

\subsubsection{Configure patch download options}

\subsubsection{Create/Edit/Delete an Update Manager baseline}

A baseline is one or more patches, extensions or upgrades.\\

Baseline types:

\begin{itemize}
\item host patch
\item host extension
\item host upgrade
\item VM hardware/tools upgrade
\item virtual appliance upgrade
\end{itemize}

A baseline group can contain one upgrade baseline per type and one or more
patch or extension baselines.

\subsubsection{Attach an Update Manager baselie to an ESXi host or cluster}

\subsubsection{Scan and remediate ESXi hosts and virtual machine hardware/tools using Update Manager}

Host patches can be staged (downloaded to the ESXi hosts) and then remediated
(applied) separately.

\subsubsection{Stage ESXi host updates}
