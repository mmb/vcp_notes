\subsection{Configure Shared Storage for vSphere}

\subsubsection{Identify storage adapters and devices}

Storage adapter types:

\begin{itemize}
\item SCSI
\item iSCSI
\item RAID
\item Fiber Channel
\item Fiber Channel over Ethernet (FCoE)
\item Ethernet
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}

  \item[HBA] host bus adapter, storage interface card

  \item [LUN] logical unit number, a device addressed by SCSI, iSCSI or Fiber
    Channel, logical disk

  \item[WWN] world-wide name, uniquely identifies a Fiber Channel adapter

  \item[target] a single storage unit that the host can access

\end{description}

\subsubsection{Identify storage naming conventions}

Some storage vendors present a single target with multiple LUNs, some present
multiple targets with one LUN each.\\

If a LUN is shared by multiple hosts, it must be presented to all hosts with
the same UUID.\\

Runtime name is not a reliable identifier for a device and is not persistent.

\subsubsection{Identify hardware/dependent hardware/software iSCSI initiator requirements}

Dependent hardware iSCSI] depends on VMware networking and interfaces provided
by VMware.

\subsubsection{Compare and contrast array thin provisioning and virtual disk thin provisioning}

\subsubsection{Describe zoning and LUN masking practices}

\subsubsection{Scan/Rescan storage}

\subsubsection{Identify use cases for FCoE}

\subsubsection{Create an NFS share for use with vSphere}

The NFS client built into ESXi uses NFS version 3.\\

In vSphere 5, Storage IO Control supports NFS.

\subsubsection{Connect to a NAS device}

\subsubsection{Enable/Configure/Disable vCenter Server storage filters}

\subsubsection{Configure/Edit hardware/dependent hardware initiators}

\subsubsection{Enable/Disable software iSCSI initiator}

\subsubsection{Configure/Edit software iSCSI initiator settings}

\subsubsection{Configure iSCSI port binding}

\subsubsection{Enable/Configure/Disable iSCSI CHAP}

\subsubsection{Determine use case for hardware/dependent hardware/software iSCSI initiator}

\subsubsection{Determine use case for and configure array thin provisioning}
