\subsection{Install and Configure VMware ESXi}

ESXi is the hypervisor running on each physical server (the virtualization
OS).\\

In vSphere 5, ESX has been completely replaced with ESXi.\\

ESXi is a thin install and doesn't have all drivers. Image builder can build
images with the required drivers.\\

ESXi maximums:

\begin{itemize}

\item 160 logical CPUs per physical machine
\item 2TB of physical RAM
\item 512 VMs per host
\item 2048 vCpus per host

\end{itemize}

host UEFI BIOS\\

In vSphere 5, Mac OSX 10.6 Snow Leopard can be virtualized (but only on Apple
hardware).\\

SNMP support was also improved in vSphere 5.

\subsubsection{Perform an interactive installation of ESXi}

\subsubsection{Deploy an ESXi host using Auto Deploy}

Auto Deploy can PXE boot stateless physical servers from a common image.\\

Auto Deploy and Image Builder:

\begin{itemize}
\item centrally manage stateless hardware
\item host configuration provided by answer file and/or host profiles
\item can deploy image based on subnet (put different types of hosts on
different subnets)
\item image builder streamlines creation of customized installation media
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Configure NTP on an ESXi Host}

To configure NTP on a host using vSphere Client go to Host / Configuration /
Time Configuration.

\subsubsection{Configure DNS and Routing on an ESXi Host}

\subsubsection{Enable/Configure/Disable hyperthreading}

\subsubsection{Enable/Size/Disable memory compression cache}

\subsubsection{License an ESXi host}
