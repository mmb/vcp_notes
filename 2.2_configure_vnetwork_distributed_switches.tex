\subsection{Configure vNetwork Distributed Switches}

The vSphere Distributed Switch creates a centralized virtual switch that
multiple ESXi hosts can subscribe to. It reduces networking configuration and
changes and allows you to centrally manage networking for VMs across multiple
ESXi hosts.\\

Distributed switch give you consistent network configuration and stats as
VMs are migrated using vMotion.\\

Distributed virtual port groups are similar to standard vSwitch port groups
but are distributed across multiple ESXi hosts.\\

The distributed switch was improved in vSphere 5.\\

NetFlow settings are configured at the vSphere distributed switch level.\\

If you don't select ``Allow normal IO on destination ports'' mirrored traffic
is allowed out but not in on destination ports.

\subsubsection{Identify vNetwork Distributed Switch (vDS) capabilities}

Distributed virtual switches have increased capabilities when compared to
standard vSwitches such as security, traffic shaping, load balancing, VLAN
settings, portblocking and VMs joining VLANs on physical networks.\\

Distributed virtual switches can be 3rd-party products like the Cisco Nexus
1000V.
