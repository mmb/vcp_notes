\subsection{Install and Configure VMware Data Recovery}

VMware Data Recovery is a VMware virtualization backup and recovery application
for VMware vSphere 4 and 5. It is deployed as a virtual appliance and
administered from vSphere.\\

VMware Data Recovery uses the vSphere API for Data Protection (VADP)
framework.\\

Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item provides backup and restore of guest virtual machines (VMs can be
powered on or off)

\item deduplication

\item file level restore

\item incremental and differential backup

\item supports VSS for Windows

\item snapshots for anytime backup

\item requires no agent on the guest, works with any OS

\item dedup and compression are automatic

\item complete management of backup and recovery through the vSphere client

\end{itemize}

The Data Recovery client plug-in and the File Level Restore client connect
to the backup appliance over port 22024.\\

Installation:

\begin{enumerate}
\item download from vSphere download page
\item deploy OVF
\item virtual appliance web GUI
\item install vCenter server plugin
\end{enumerate}

A 60-day evaluation is available if you are not using Essentials Plus,
Standard, Enterprise, Enterprise Plus or have purchased a license a la carte.\\

Limitations:

\begin{itemize}

\item backup datastore recommended to be no more than 1TB of dedup data and
2 destinations total (500G if CIFS)

\item 8 concurrent VMDK backups

\item maximum of 100 VMs can be backed up per vdr appliance

\item maximum of 10 VDR appliances per vCenter server (1000 vms per datacenter)

\item does not provide a method to get backup data onto tape or offsite

\end{itemize}

New in Vsphere 5:

\begin{enumerate}

\item uses CentOS 5.5 64-bit

\item swap files are no longer included in backups

\item integrity checks and reclaim operations can be scheduled, resumed and
run in the background

\item backup peformance improved

\item email reporting

\end{enumerate}
